# Survey with list view
## PHP demo survey with list and view page

### The List page will:

- Provide loaded links to the View page for every survey
- Identify the Date Created, Title, Description and Creator's Name (Admin's First & Last Name) of each survey
- Data inside the List page must be tabular data (included in HTML tables with TH elements)
- Become the index.php file inside of the surveys folder

### The View page will:

- Implement the Survey classes inside a survey_view.php page for data access
- Defend itself from invalid entry by redirecting users back to the List page
